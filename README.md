# Monte Carlo Tree Search Hearthstone AI

This fork of SabberStone includes my Monte Carlo Tree Search agent, which I built under the guidance of
[Dr. Truong-Huy D. Nguyen](https://truonghuy.github.io/) as my research professor at Fordham University.

This fork also includes TycheAgent, which Kai Bornemann built as a part
of Alexander Dockhorn's [Hearthstone AI Competition](https://dockhorn.antares.uberspace.de/wordpress/), and was [one of
the top performing agents.](https://dockhorn.antares.uberspace.de/wordpress/results/)

### There are still bugs...
My agent is too slow and not optimized, so he doesn't win very often against more refined agents like TycheAgent. And, every now and then
the program will throw an exception. I'm still working on that.
