# Combinatorial Fusion Analysis with Hearthstone

This fork of SabberStone includes my Monte Carlo Tree Search agent, which I built under the guidance of
[Dr. Truong-Huy D. Nguyen](https://truonghuy.github.io/) as my research professor at Fordham University.

This fork also includes TycheAgent, which Kai Bornemann built as a part
of Alexander Dockhorn's [Hearthstone AI Competition](https://dockhorn.antares.uberspace.de/wordpress/), and was [one of
the top performing agents.](https://dockhorn.antares.uberspace.de/wordpress/results/)
